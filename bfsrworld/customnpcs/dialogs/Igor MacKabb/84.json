    "DialogText": "Rules, master? Ahhh! Rules to be broken, then to be punished!Monsters fear sixteen. They cannot be born sixteen blocks from you. Seventeen blocks, and *POOF* monster! They then sneak in to get you!From seventeen all the way to one hundred twenty-eight, it is monster spawn fun! If you run to one hundreed twenty-nine, they will despawn. You wouldn't do that, Master? You wouldn't leave a monster unkilled, would you?For your shop, Master, I recommend 24 to 48, in what ever direction you like. Now make it better. Light up everything around. Light up the caves! Light up the surface! Make sure those monsters have no place to spawn but your death trap! For a little extra fun, some cursed earth will really spice it up.If you doubt me, just walk back to that line they put at the teleporters. Turn around and look! The monsters will start poofing! You can come closer and see when they stop poofing! ",
