    "DialogText": "Oh? Hahaha yeah, Skyblock. That's where you start in a dimension that has, like, nothing. I mean it. There is no ground. No bedrock. You fall, you die. Some will start you on a small, mostly infertile platform, and others will go extreme and start you off on a tree on top of a single dirt block.Those packs include a few bonus things that get you through the initial game. Usually there are sieves and composters. So you take wood to make compost barrels--which can also catch water. You put leaves and apples in the composters to make dirt. You sift the dirt for stones. You make cobblestone from the stones, etc. Eventually you make an infinite cobblestone generator and the lava to support it from this or that thing. It starts to take off from there. It's worth trying at least once.",
