    "DialogText": "You can make these little lenses... laser focii, focuses, focalbutts. Whatever. They are categorized by color. Generally speaking, if you want a specific type of ore, you want to install a focus in a drill with a similar color to the ore. So we like uranium and yellorium here. The yellow and lime ones do the job. You can stack these up to focus the drill. Without them, the drill pulls out whatever it feels like, for all we know.When you put them in, the odds just start to favor more of what you want, but it's never going to be 100%. For one, other stuff shares the same color. With those lime focuses, you start to pull out lots of emeralds on top of the uranium. All the other stuff still shows up like before, but at a lower rate.",
