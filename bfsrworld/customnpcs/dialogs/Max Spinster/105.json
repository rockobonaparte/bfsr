    "DialogText": "Trajan starts here with this 9x9x6--inner size, mind you--reactor. It has 5 fuel rods in an X in the center. It has some resonant ender running out in all four directions from that X. If you do it right, you get something that spits out a little over 8,000 mb/tick of steam. A single turbine enclosure can handle up to 2,000 mb/tick of steam, so that's why there are four of them.Each fan blade can handle 25 mb/tick of steam. So that's 80 blades. Each layer of shaft has four blades, so that's 20 full levels of blades. Each turbine has 37 blocks of enderium for its coils. It just so happens that amount keeps the turbines spinning juuuuust around 1800 rpm. It turns out reactors are very efficient at that speed. So yeah, good stuff.Trajan can power just about all those laser drills over there that lady has been dealing with. She's kind of annoying, but she set us up with seemingly infinite fuel and automated tending the reactors. Heck, I probably don't have to wear this anymore. :(",
