But if you want to know what's coming, then you will need some cyanite from either spent fuel or from a goofy craft recipe with yellorium. So it's implied you already have a reactor. Once you put a coolant port into your reactor, it switches from producing power to producing steam. You want to run that steam into turbines. However, you have to use pipes that can handle that volume of steam, as well as the volume of water that's coming back. If you don't know, just set up the fuel port and run the reactor. Look at the steam output and you'll know what you are dealing with.Actually... I got ahead of myself! You'll need to get water into the reactor first. A lot of water! See that crazy water pumping rig? Um, you don't *need* that really, but it'll be slow going until you have enough water running. Think about it.",
