Those are the best materials, period. You can go look up what it takes to make those. It's a real pain in the butt.It's likely possible you can't extract all the energy out of your turbines effectively. The pipes we're using are the best. You are probably better off using tesseracts. They have infinite flow over infinite distance. You might even do that for the water and steam exchanges.We have a more modest setup over in the other corner, but it's boring. We call it \"Hadrian\" after the Roman emperor that came after Trajan who reduced the borders to something \"manageable.\" Boooring.",
