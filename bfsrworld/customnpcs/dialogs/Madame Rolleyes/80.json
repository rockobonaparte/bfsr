But Admiral Luna is my favorite. She doesn't screw around! She's more blunt than a hammer.One time I caught her in the Dad Bar, asking out dads. I know, right? I mean, a dad. Like, we live in interesting times, but you have a good shot they're already married. She wasn't even flirting. It was just kind of like, \"Hi, who are you? I am Admiral Luna. Let's go on a date.\" I think she's used to just getting whatever she wants. I'm jealous.",
