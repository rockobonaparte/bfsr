This was supposed to be some kind of vacation or whatever, but it's been going forever!I know a lot of the people in Baby's First Space City don't like me, but whatever. They all call my Rolleyes. Well, at least Admiral Luna seems to be cool with me. She at least uses my full name: Madam Rolleyes.Eh well, Nurse Pinky has a crush on Mr. Overworldo, but that guy has no self-esteem because he farts uncontrollably. It has something to do with the diet. I don't know. But Admiral Luna is my favorite. She doesn't screw around! She's more blunt than a hammer.One time I caught her in the Dad Bar, asking out dads. I know, right? I mean, a dad. Like, we live in interesting times, but you have a good shot they're already married. She wasn't even flirting. It was just kind of like, \"Hi, who are you? I am Admiral Luna. Let's go on a date.\" I think she's used to just getting whatever she wants. I'm jealous.Also, I think all the weenies working the Minefactory Reloaded stuff and the \"nukes\" or whatever should just kiss and make up or whatever. They have this stupid rivalry thing going on.",
