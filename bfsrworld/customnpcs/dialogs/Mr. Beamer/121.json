    "DialogText": "I saw the posting for a vacation to a faraway place. Little did I know that meant being beamed into a hard disk in another universe. How do they even know that's technically far away? Isn't that like dividing by zero?At least Madame Rolleyes got to go on assignment to the Beach Party dimension. She just sits there, waiting for dumb babies to teleport in without a way out. She tries to get them to kill themselves for fun.What really bothers me is this chair. Like, it's fine and all... when I get to sit in it. It is from a mod, so it doesn't teleport. When some butthead pushes that button over there, I get warped off to so some dark place. The chair doesn't come with me though! So I fall on the ground, or whatever I'm falling on to. It's another dimension of blackness. I have to kind of set myself right here and wait to get beamed back so I can put my butt down again in the chair.",
