In this Baby's First Space Race stuff, it's true you can't swing a cat around without its claws digging into normally precious resources, but when you're out there, playing hardcore survival modpacks or whatever, they like to mess with you. It's hard to get some stuff. However, if you have some RF power, and you need random stuff, you might as well throw down a fisher. It gives you more than just fish! Some things:1. Fish. Haha I had to say it again. I like fish. But if you are having trouble finding diet options, that's one more type of food. You can also dry them in racks for jerky.2. Potions. People throw out perfectly good potions!3. Rubber stuff. You can get rubber saplings, or just rubber.4. Plastic bags with random goodies. The bags are nice if you haven't gotten backpacks or whatever yet.5. Spawn eggs! If you *really* need a breeding pair of cows, there's a chance from those bags that you will get them. Be careful! Some of the stuff that spawns might blow up on you!6. Enchanted books! If all else fails, you can try to finagle them into recipes for an ender quarry.There's also other random gunk that gets into them. That's just a start.",
