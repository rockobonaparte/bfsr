By the door here are a few tool racks with paper picks. If there aren't, well, Paige Turner down with the shops gives them away for free from leftover paper. They'll let you mine a good... 9 blocks or so of stone so you can claw your way out onto the surface. If that's too much for you, you can go play over in the park. It has wood and stone. You can practice there and get a stone pick for your troubles. But pay it forward! You want to keep the sandbox clean and ready for the next poor fool.",
