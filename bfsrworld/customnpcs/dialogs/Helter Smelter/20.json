    "DialogText": "Channels are like pipes that can connect the drains on smelteries to other drains, or casting basins, or other storage methods. You can use them in a modpack that doesn't have pipes of any kind. Since this pack has pipes, you really only ever use it to get fluids back into a smeltery. To do that, you want to place a drain on your smeltery so that it points INSIDE the smeltery. Do not put a faucet on it. Instead, put a channel on the other side of it. I mean the side from where you normally use the smeltery. Make sure it doesn't have a little nub trying to connect to nearby drains or objects because that will foul things up. Put a tank on top and put a faucet on that. When you right click that faucet, it will pour into the channel, which will pour into the drain, which will pour into the smeltery.If you go upstairs, you can see a smeltery with one.",
