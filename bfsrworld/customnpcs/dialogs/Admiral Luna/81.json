    "DialogText": "I must admit I'm getting into Academy folklore here. As the story goes, the Navy wanted to sneak war assets by compressing them in space time into hard disks. The idea was you could then deploy this thing elsewhere very suddenly without all the travel in between. They set up one of the smaller ships for an experiment using spatial storage. They beamed the ship away just fine, but when they restored it in place, something terrible happened. Stuff like hell breaking loose... literally. Everybody was crazy. The ship's nuclear reactor filled with blood. Complete madness. A real horror.It was a fun story to scare young sailors, but I never saw anything to do with it. Consider I deal with space and inter-dimensional travel here. It is probably a myth. They say those crazy quest books they give you have something about it. It is probably just a little fluff to keep up your spirits. I am sorry.",
