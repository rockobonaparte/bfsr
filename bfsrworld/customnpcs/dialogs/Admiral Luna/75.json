You can infer this by looking at the moon from the Overworld. You want a nice, full moon. Prepare a matter receiver at your base, fully powered. Pack a matter transmitter so you can teleport back, along with a sufficiently-charged energy cell. Pack another matter receiver so you can eventually return to the moon. This will let you move freely to-and-from the moon without building any more rockets. Outfit yourself in some non-trivial armor. I also recommend a good crossbow, and some melee weapon with tremendous knockback. You do not want to be distracted when building your base by the denizens of the moon. A weapon with knockback will send them flying far, far away in the low-gravity environment of the moon.",
