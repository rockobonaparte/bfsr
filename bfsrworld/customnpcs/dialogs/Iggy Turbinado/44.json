    "DialogText": "We have 48 blades powering 4 straight rings of electrum--the shiny stuff on the end. That electrum are the \"coils\" and they generat the power. Each generator produces 400 mb/tick of steam, and each fan blade can cool down 25 mb/tick of steam. We have three generators. So that's 1200 mb/tick of steam. Take that by 25, and there you go, 48. We could have made a more powerful turbine from enderium, for example, but we felt we wanted to showcase less advanced materials. I mean, it's a tree farm, for Pete's sake! That's also why we stuck to pretty weak pipes. Those hardened fluiducts handling the steam can only do 600 mb/tick, so we needed to create two steam lines into the turbine. We set up two fluid lines out as a back up. We don't really need all the water so we dump half of it, just to be safe.It produces upwards of 9700 RF/tick of energy. That's over 240 furnace generators. Hmm, I did say a lower number before, didn't I?With that much power, I'd suggest putting some into a battery for shop power and sending some into a mining laser with just one precharger on it. You'd have to use redstone energy fluxduct to handle that much power. However, you'd get free ores out of it.",
