    "DialogText": "Ehh nothing much else to add if you talked to the other nukes. We call this reactor \"Hadrian.\" It's a lot more modest. This is one you can make if enderium and resonant ender isn't in the cards for you.It's using electrum for the coils, which isn't quite as good, but \"good enough.\" It can still do some laser drilling.There is one really cool trick. The steam and water ports between the reactor and the turbines are directly connected, so you don't need super-duper pipes to keep up with the water/steam demand. You will still have to slowly get some water into the reactor in the beginning, but it will just exchange with the turbine afterwards. Pretty neat, right?",
