Make sure you have spare fuel, a parachute, teleporter, etc. Actually, this time, I also recommend you have a jetpack of some kind. You are going to be moving around between a bunch of rocks in open space. This can end quote poorly for you if you don\u0027t have a way to cross giant gaps with some control! Also, a frying pan is nice when you fly to another asteroid. It lets you quickly swat away the welcoming committee that is usually waiting for you.",

I should double-emphasize that digging straight down an asteroid is seriously dangerous business! You also want some good ranged weaponry for when you try to jump onto a new asteroid. Mobs spawn like crazy on to the top of asteroids. Holy hand grenades or somehow getting arrows with knockback will help. Also, a knockback melee weapon when you land on the asteroid will seriously help out. Don\u0027t try to use a digital miner for this; it can\u0027t detect ilmenite. You\u0027re going to have to knock around some asteroids to find this stuff. Finally, YOU NEED SILK TOUCH to mine the ore blocks. You need the complete ore blocks to make the Orion Drives.",
