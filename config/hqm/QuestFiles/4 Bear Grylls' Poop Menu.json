Heck, you might be playing this on a server with friends logging in at different times, and nobody knows what\u0027s up. Maybe they text you or something to ask what to do. To keep you all from having to actually talk to each other like normal, social human beings, try the clipboard. You can lay out lists of tasks that have to be done, and then you can mark them off.",

OpenBlocks' elevators are a better option for your base, but another pack might not have them, or that pack may charge you your XP to use it, for some dumb reason. An alternative is a dark steel ladder. Getting to dark steel tech will take a little bit of a fuss with EnderIO, but if you play with that mod in this pack, you get a ladder you can climb and descend at twice the normal rate.",
