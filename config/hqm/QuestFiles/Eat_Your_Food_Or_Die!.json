{"name":"Eat Your Food Or Die!","description":"The day will come that you want to play some kind of thematic survival modpack . . . that is not this one. All the cool kids like to combine a holy trinity of: Pam\u0027s Harvestcraft, Cooking for Blockheads, and Hunger Plus or Spice of Life. Harvestcraft gives you a ton of food possibilities. Cooking for Blockheads gives you a means of sorting out what of all that you can actually make right now, and the others give you MOTIVATION. They make your player rather starve to death than eat bread for the 100th time in a row. This chapter will go into the different food possibilities. It will start with what crazy things you can do with Vanilla Minecraft ingredients. It will then cross over into CrazyTown and plan an entire diet around tofu. We don\u0027t do this out of principle. We do this because we can. Well, I guess that\u0027s a principle in itself. Anyhow...","quests":[{"uuid":"e593fa33-65b5-47cd-b44a-8b2dd21b2841","name":"Floured in Praise","x":23,"y":12,"icon":{"id":"harvestcraft:flouritem"},"commandrewards":[]},{"uuid":"d33db9df-c2c5-448e-8f2a-98ad040a5761","name":"Taste The Rainbow","description":"This is just kind of here, really.
