We did not disable the normal Minecraft tools, but the versions in this pack are generally better for various reasons. For one, they can be repaired for much less than remaking the tool. You can upgrade them in other ways. Beyond that, there is a smeltery, which can double your metal yield for ore. Later in the sequence, we will explore steelmaking using electrically-powered machines.",
