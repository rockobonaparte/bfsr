You will also take 4 hearts of damage each time you do this. So you will need to pace yourself and have food on standby to heal yourself.",

You can build a Nether Portal this way, without having tools that could mine obsidian in the wild. Here\u0027s what you do. Build a smeltery drain, but point it INTO your smeltery. I like to put mine over the smeltery controller. Do not install a faucet on it. Install a channel on the outside of that drain. Place a seared tank above it. Put a faucet on the tank such that it\u0027s over the channel. Fill the tank with one bucket of lava. Right click the faucet. It will pour lava into the smeltery. Fill the tank with a bucket of water. Right click the faucet. When the water goes in, you will have 2 ingots worth of obsidian, which is equivalent to one block of obsidian.",
